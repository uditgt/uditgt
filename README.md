HowdyðŸ¤ 

I am an experienced Data Scientist who has spent many a years in Fintech and playing with financial datasets. It was at UCLA that I began playing with datasets, and I've enjoyed working at the cross-section of business, technology and quantiative analysis since. I am passionate about python and data science, and some of my project work is available here - [Projects](https://github.com/uditgt/Projects) *(curation-in-progress as I find more time)*, [ML using Python](https://github.com/uditgt/ML_python). 

You can find my posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@uditg), where I (recently) started sharing my thoughts on applied data science and block-chain, which I find fascinating. More to come there. 

ðŸ“« Best way to reach me is through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uditgt/).   
ðŸŒ± I enjoy figuring our new tools and tech. At present, I'm learning Docker and [Crypto & Blockchain landscape](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto).  
âš¡ I love hiking and am a proud graduate from UCLA Anderson. Go Bruins!
