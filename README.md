Howdy🤠

I am an experienced Data Scientist who has spent many a years playing with classical models and financial datasets. It was at UCLA that I began playing with datasets, and I've enjoyed working at the cross-section of business, technology and data science (or quantiative analysis) since. Some of my project work, including with more fancier models, is available here - [Projects](https://github.com/uditgt/Projects) *(curation-in-progress as I find more time)*, [ML using Python](https://github.com/uditgt/ML_python). 

You can find my posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@uditg), where I (*try to*) share thoughts on applied data science problems and general musings on my experimentation with block-chain projects. 

📫 Best way to reach me is through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uditgt/).   
🌱 I enjoy figuring our new tools and tech. At present, I'm learning Docker and [Blockchain use-cases](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto).  
⚡ I love hiking and am a proud graduate from UCLA Anderson. Go Bruins!  
👨‍🎓 Certifications - *(to be added)*
